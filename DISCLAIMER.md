   THIS PROGRAM AND IT'S MEASUREMENTS IS NOT INTENDED TO GUIDE ACTIONS TO TAKE, OR NOT
   TO TAKE, REGARDING EXPOSURE TO RADIATION. THE GEIGER KIT AND IT'S SOFTWARE ARE FOR
   EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT RELY ON THEM IN HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS!

Seriously. Designing radiation-hardened circuitry--especially involving silicon devices--is *hard*. Designing it with safety-device levels of reliability is even *harder*. The DIYGeiger kit, while an excellent kit and educational tool, is not rad-hardened let alone designed for reliability under meaningful radiation exposure.
